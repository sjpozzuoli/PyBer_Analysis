# PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis

### The purpose of this analysis is to compare the ride-sharing data of PyBer by Urban, Suburban and Rural city types. We will compare the data and summarize the ways these differences can be used by the decision-makers at Pyber.

## Results

#### The above chart breaks down the information by city type. The total amount of rides is greatly skewed towards Urban areas, but that is to be expected as they are usually much more populated than Suburban or Rural areas. To accomodate the larger populations and, thus, greater number of rides, there are almost 5 times more drivers in the Urban areas than Suburban and Rural combined.

#### When it comes to revenue generated, it is also to be expected that most came from Urban areas due to the much higher amount of total rides. However, the interesting piece of the data is disparity between average fare per ride and driver. From a passenger perspective, an individual living in a Rural area will have to spend 13% more per ride than someone living in a Suburabn area and 40% more than someone living in an Urban area. The main cause of this can be attributed to the further distances people in Rural areas must travel to go shopping, go to restaurants, visit friends and family, etc. Due to the longer distances and far fewer drivers, it is also to be expected that the average fare, when broken down by Driver, is higher in Rural areas than Urban and Suburban areas.

#### The data was also broken down to provide a visual line chart of the total fares by month. The information displayed here is consistent with the analysis provided above, where the majority of fare revenue comes from Urban areas, and that is true month over month.

## Summary

#### There are some interesting conclusions that can be drawn from the depictions above. If I were to advise the CEO on a few business recommendations based on them, they would be the following:

1. Exploring an increase in hiring of drivers and slightly lowering of costs in Rural areas. Riders in the Rural areas have to pay a much higher price per ride. This could ultimately lead to a further drop off of ridership because of the higher prices they have to pay. Individuals may explore other forms of getting around, like public transportation. 
2. Limit the number of drivers hired in Urban areas to increase the revenue generated for the drivers. With the way the current data stands, there were 1625 total rides taken, but 2405 drivers. There are more drivers than total rides taken, which means there are drivers who worked without providing any rides. As a way to cut company costs, some of these drivers could be let go as there are not enough rides to be shared.
